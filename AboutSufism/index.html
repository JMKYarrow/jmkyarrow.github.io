        <div class="row"><blockquote>“Sufism means being particularly aware of God’s loving presence”</blockquote></div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-5"><p class="sectionBody">Sufi Islam is all about having a strong connection with Allah. A Sufi Muslim will pray and “passes from conscious thought and arrives at a state of union with God” – this ‘arrival’ is called baqa. The experience with Allah is known as Mysticism.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-7"><p class="sectionBody">Mysticism: A feeling of unparalleled closeness with Allah, which makes the rest of life seem insignificant to the one who is experiencing this connection. The feeling is so divine that anyone who may experience mysticism, an event which is usually quite short, few and far between, will want to have the same closeness with Allah again.</p></div>        
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-7"><p class="sectionBody">Sufism is all about the spirit, it focuses on forgetting anything material on earth and considering the more important things like bringing one’s closeness with God to an exceptional level and being “absorbed in the consciousness of god”.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-5"><p class="sectionBody">Love is a key concept for Sufis, they believe that it should be the foundation for anything that you do and it won’t fail you. Sufis also are entirely tolerant of other religions as “All religious paths are attempts to find God”.</p></div>

            <div class="col-xs-12"><p class="sectionBody">There are various different orders (or communities) of Sufism or Tariqas and they all have a leader called a Shaikh. ‘Inner Circle’ members of a Tariqa who have a close relation with their Shaikh are known as murids and one is elected to follow if the current Tariqa knows that they are dying.</p></div>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-7"><p class="sectionBody">Shahada is the declaration of faith (or creed) in Islam. It, most basically. Is the acceptance of ‘the Oneness of God’ – that Allah is the only god – and the acceptance that Muhammed was his messenger or prophet.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-5"><p class="sectionBody">It is spoken as follows: “(I testify that) There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God.”</p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9"><p class="sectionBody">One of the most common forms of prayer performed Sufism is known as Dhikr. Dhikr as a word refers to the ‘Remembrance of Allah’ and in practice is the repetition of short prayers or phrases. Dhikr is a ritual in many Tariqas and can involve many different things, ranging from mental repetition to singing and dancing. Dhikr is valued quite highly in many Sufi orders as it helps to remove the followers from the material world and focus on the praise and connection with God.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-3"><p class="sectionBody">The Shahada (Declaration of Faith) can be used as one of the repeated phrases in Dhikr and (If accepted by the order) part of any musical rituals.</p></div>

    <!--Fasting and Ramadan-->

        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="sectionHeader">Sawm</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4"><p class="sectionBody">Sawm is Islam’s word for fasting and isn’t any different in Sufism (since it isn’t really a different denomination, derivation or sect). However, it is likely to be strictly adhered to by all Sufis as it is one of the five pillars of Islam and Sufi Muslims are devout as a result of their close connection with Allah.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-8"><p class="sectionBody">Ramadan is the largest fasting ritual in Islam. It lasts for about a month, yet is based on the Islamic calendar (which still has 12 months but is what is known as a lunar calendar and therefore has some inaccuracies). While the sun is out, all consumption of food and drink is forbidden, along with other activities such as smoking and any sexual activity – however some people are exempt from these restrictions if they are very young (below 12), very old, hurt or ill, pregnant or menstruating at the time.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12"><p class="sectionBody">Bear in mind that this doesn't mean that they won't do anything for Ramadan - they might fast when they are ready at a later date, or they might do some charity giving if the former doesn't seem to be a possiblity.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="sectionHeader">Eid ul-Fitr</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12"><p class="sectionBody">Eid ul-Fitr is the celebration or festival that happens right at the end of Ramadan, after there has been a sighting of the new moon. At this time, those who have been taking part will visit the mosque to pray and will also have a large meal with friends and family afterwards – one large meal will take place during the day as it will be the first daytime meal since before Ramadan. During this festival, all Muslims will wear their best clothes to show the importance of the celebration.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row"><blockquote>“Muslims are not only celebrating the end of fasting, but thanking Allah for the help and strength that he gave them throughout the previous month to help them practise self-control”</blockquote></div>

            <h1 class="sectionHeader">Zakah</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4"><p class="sectionBody">The third pillar of Islam, Zakah (or Zakat) is the name given to ‘Compulsory Giving’ in Islam. The giving of specifically 2.5% of each Muslim’s wealth per Annum is seen as an act of worship towards Allah and a form of ‘Self Purification’. Any giving outside this specific figure is not counted as Zakah.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><p class="sectionBody">Along with the material bonus of helping to look after the poor, Zakah is a yearly reminder to Muslims about possession: Everything in the world was created by Allah, so on a cosmic level we own nothing.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><p class="sectionBody">The teachings of Zakah heavily line up with what is advocated by Sufis; They believe how it is important to separate oneself from the material world and what we have physically – and Zakah also teaches just that.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row"><blockquote>“Since we cannot take anything with us when we die we need not cling to it”</blockquote></div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="sectionHeader">Eid ul-Adha</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12"><p class="sectionBody">Eid ul-Adha is the second most significant festival in Islam. It is concerned with the remembrance of the prophet Ibrahim’s sacrifice (or willingness to) for Allah.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4"><p class="sectionBody">In the story of the sacrifice, Ibrahim is approached by God to sacrifice his son as an ‘act of obedience’. He is tempted not to but in the end, he submits and decided to fulfil God’s request by making the sacrifice. At the last moment (as Ibrahim is about to proceed with the killing) he is given a lamb to do it with instead as he has already proven his allegiance to Allah.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-5"><p class="sectionBody">Muslims who are financially able to, are obliged to sacrifice a sheep on the day of this festival. Due to regulations in the UK, this must be done in a validated slaughterhouse, which may take away from the authenticity of the festival. Once this has been done, the meat is given out equally between family, friends and strangers who are less fortunate. As Eid ul-Adha is centred around giving, it is customary to help the poor celebrate too buy donating a small sum to help them get some new clothes too.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-3"><p class="sectionBody">Just like in Eid ul-Fitr, Muslims put on their best clothes and go to the Mosque to pray and give thanks to Allah. After that presents are exchanged between family and friends.</p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6"><p class="sectionBody">Hajj is the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca (or Makkah), which is situated in Saudi Arabia. It is the fifth pillar of Islam and it is declared that each ‘physically fit’ Muslim should make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least one time during their life, during the last month of the Islamic year.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-6"><p class="sectionBody">All the pilgrims gather outside a black shrine, known as the Kaaba (which was supposedly built by Ibrahim long ago) to worship Allah. Every pilgrim or ‘Hajji’ wears similar white garments to symbolise Islamic fraternity and to demonstrate how in the eyes of Allah we are all equal.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row"><blockquote>“The hajj was one of the last public acts of worship performed by Muhammad before his death.”</blockquote></div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="sectionHeader">Jihad</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-5"><p class="sectionBody">Greater Jihad refers to one’s internal struggle against sin and temptation. It is about the one’s urge to be the best Muslim they can be. Everyone’s Jihad may be different as there are different things for people to work towards: if you do smoke then part of your Greater Jihad would be trying to give it up or for some, just trying to adhere to the five pillars of Islam would be a way of them embracing their internal Jihad.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-3"><p class="sectionBody">For Sufis, who are devout Muslims who already think and feel beyond the material of the world, this struggle may be less difficult or could feel completely different.</p></div>
            <div class="col-md-4"><p class="sectionBody">Other forms of Jihad such as holy war, ’lesser jihad’, wouldn’t matter to Sufi Muslims at all; this is because, by nature, Sufis are tolerant of other religions and faiths so they see no reason to force their beliefs on others, rather let their way of thinking speak for itself.</p></div>
        </div>

First, it was the day when Noah left his Ark and Secondly, it is the day during which God saved Moses from the Egyptians.
